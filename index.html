        <p class="center">
            Geelong Christian Assembly is a local church that meets in Vines Road Community Centre in Hamlyn
            Heights in Geelong. We enjoy meeting up to learn, pray and worship together.
            <br>
            We put a high emphasis on learning and trying to follow the Bible in how we meet together because
            we believe it is God’s word and His instructions to us. We also put a high emphasis on
            communicating back to God by praying to Him together and asking for His direction.
            <br>
            The way we do church may be a little different to what you would be used to so please take a look
            around to website or contact us if you would like to know more. The frequently asked questions
            page has some more details about our beliefs and practices.

                      focused on the topic of remembering the Lord Jesus. Toward the end we take the bread and wine as
                      a way to remember the Lord Jesus.
